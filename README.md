# is-it-harmful?

A library dedicated to detecting if a shell command is "harmful."

## Project Goals

1. **Command Analysis:**
   - Parse shell commands to assess risk.

2. **Threat Detection:**
   - Identify harmful patterns, such as file deletion, obfuscation or data exposure.

3. **User Alerts:**
   - Notify users of potentially harmful commands.

4. **Database of Harmful Commands:**
   - Maintain an updated list of known threats.

5. **Customizable Safety Levels:**
   - Allow users to set security thresholds.

6. **Reporting and Logging:**
   - Log and report harmful command detections.

7. **False Positive Reduction:**
   - Minimize incorrect alerts for safe commands.

## Outline

1. **Research:**
   - Study shell security and existing tools.

2. **Prototype:**
   - Develop initial threat detection and command parsing.

3. **Testing:**
   - Validate accuracy with test cases.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Create user guides and API documentation.

5. **Community Engagement:**
   - Encourage feedback and collaboration.

## Considerations

- **Performance:**
  - Ensure minimal impact on system performance.

- **Cross-Platform:**
  - Support various shell environments.

- **Security:**
  - Protect against new vulnerabilities and data leaks.

- **Legal/Ethical:**
  - Be mindful of implications in different environments.

- **Updates:**
  - Regularly update the threat database.

- **Community Review:**
  - Engage open-source community for audits and suggestions.

This project aims to provide a reliable tool for identifying and avoiding harmful shell commands, through collaborative and community-driven development.
